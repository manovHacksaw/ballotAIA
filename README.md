# Ballotaia - A Decentralized Voting Application

**Ballotaia** is a decentralized application (DApp) that transforms traditional voting processes by leveraging blockchain technology. Built on the AIA blockchain, Ballotaia ensures secure, transparent, and efficient voting for organizations, communities, and nonprofits, creating an inclusive platform for democratic decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Decentralization**: Ballotaia operates on a decentralized network, ensuring that no single entity controls the voting process.
- **Security**: Advanced cryptographic techniques protect votes from tampering, making the voting process reliable and trustworthy.
- **Transparency**: All voting activities are recorded on the blockchain and are publicly verifiable, fostering trust and accountability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface designed for users of all technical backgrounds, enabling straightforward participation and setup.
- **Flexible Voting Methods**: Supports various voting mechanisms, including single-choice, ranked-choice, and weighted voting.
- **Real-Time Results**: Votes are counted in real time, offering immediate feedback for participants.
- **Global Accessibility**: Remote-friendly design allows participation from anywhere, ensuring inclusivity in decision-making.

## Use Cases

- **Corporate Governance**: Ideal for board elections, shareholder voting, and other critical governance decisions.
- **Community Engagement**: Perfect for local governments and community organizations to hold referendums and town hall meetings.
- **Nonprofit Organizations**: Simplifies board elections, grant approvals, and funding allocations for nonprofits.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **MetaMask** or similar wallet extension for Web3 integration

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ballotaia.git
   cd ballotaia
   cd client

2. Install Dependencies:

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.


### Smart Contract Deployment

To deploy Ballotaiaâ€™s smart contracts to a local AIA blockchain node or a testnet:

1. Start a local AIA blockchain node::
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ballotaia.git
   cd ballotaia
   cd web3
   
2. Deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   
 #### Smart Contract Link

You can find the deployed smart contract at: https://testnet.aiascan.com/address/0x1B2d15d76255Ea450718e02892F7fCb52dfDa2E3
   
## Running Tests

To test the Ballotaia smart contracts, use the following command:

    
    npx hardhat test


## Usage
